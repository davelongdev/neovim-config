# Neovim Config Files

This is my neovim config.  I started with the modular version of the [kickstart neovim config](https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim) and made many customizations from there.  

## Why Neovim?

Neovim is my preferred text editor.

I use it to do things like taking notes, drafting content for websites, and editing code.

While vim and neovim come with a pretty steep learning curve, I've found that I'm able to be the most productive in the neovim environment.  

I enjoy being able to use the keyboard as much as I can when coding, so a modal editor like neovim works really well for me.

I like that neovim is lightweight and fast but at the same time very powerful and customizable.

I like the neovim community.  There are so many great people using neovim.  I like that I can always find help quickly if I'm having an issue with something and I can't figure out how to fix it on my own.

## Other text editors

I've experimented with other editors like emacs, vscode, sublime text editor, helix, and pycharm.  I like to try different editors to learn more about how to optomize my workflow, but so far I've always found myself gravitating back to neovim.
